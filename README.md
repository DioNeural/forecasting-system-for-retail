## 📁 **Projects**

### 1. 📊 **Data Exploration**

In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset to understand the business context and data structure. The focus was on uncovering patterns and initial insights to inform predictive modeling.

#### 🔑 **Key Highlights**:
- **Data Understanding**: Analyzed sales data from a retail chain covering a two-year period.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Identified sales trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations to clearly communicate data insights.

### 2. 🔮 **Predictive Models**

This project involved building and evaluating predictive models to forecast product demand. The objective was to develop a robust system that captures seasonal and promotional effects to optimize stock levels.

#### 🔑 **Key Highlights**:
- **Feature Engineering**: Created features to capture promotional effects, seasonal trends, and cyclic patterns.
- **Modeling**: Implemented various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and refined models for better accuracy.

### 3. 🌐 **Social Network Analysis**

In this project, I applied social network analysis techniques to understand relationships and interactions between products. The analysis aimed to identify cannibalization and halo effects among products.

#### 🔑 **Key Highlights**:
- **Graph Construction**: Built a graph representing product correlations using sales data.
- **Network Analysis**: Used tools like Gephi to visualize and analyze the network, identifying clusters and key relationships.
- **Business Insights**: Derived actionable insights on product interactions and promotional strategies.

## 📜 **Detailed Project Description: Demand Forecasting System**

### Business Understanding
- **Client**: A retail software solutions provider.
- **Objective**: Forecast daily product demand to optimize stock levels in a supermarket chain, considering promotional and seasonal effects.

### Data Understanding
- **Datasets**: Sales and stock data, calendar information, store details, and product metadata.
- **Initial Insights**: Identified sales patterns, external factors impact, and seasonal variations.

### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and anomalies to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generated features to capture key factors influencing demand, such as promotional periods and cyclical patterns.

### Modeling and Evaluation
- **Approach**: Followed CRISP-DM methodology, using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models to predict demand, incorporating features like "PROMO_CANIBAL" to account for cannibalization effects.
- **Performance**: Models demonstrated improved accuracy over baseline, effectively capturing promotional impacts.

### Recommender Systems
- **Implementation**: Developed a recommendation system to suggest optimal promotional strategies, aiming to maximize overall profit.
